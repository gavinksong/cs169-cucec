Feature: Admin should have special privileges

  As an admin
  So that I can manage mentor and students activities 
  I should be able to access the admin dashboard
  
  Scenario: I am presented with the admin sign up screen
    # Given I am on the admin signup page
    # And I fill in "admin_email" with "email@gmail.com"
    # And I fill in "admin_password" with "mypassword"
    # And I press "Login"
    # Then I should be on the admin dashboard page
    #I should see special admin features after loggin in
